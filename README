Careers Crawler

Scrape the contents of careers.stackoverflow.com and make pretty graphs using the Google Visualization API.
Just run script.rb, it will generate json files ready to be fed to the google visualization api. 
See html for examples.

Totally in alpha stage, the pie graph doesn't work yet and the most interesting viz are yet to come.
